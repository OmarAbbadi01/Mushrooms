# mushrooms
A Data mining project to predict whether the mushroom is edible (safe to eat) or poisonous using R.

This project is made in 2022-2023 fall semester during the 'Data Mining' course with my partners Moawiah Ararawi and Mahmoud Qasem, and our supervisor Dr. Anas Melhem. The goal is to classify mushrooms to be edible or poisonous, we used Naive Bayes classifier with Laplace to ensure best accuracy, the result accuracy was near 95% which was high enough for such critical task.
